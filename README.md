# AppStore 

This project is about pull specific information of  all applications on iTunes. 

## Getting Started

This proccess has several step. It also has severeal requirements before run.

### Prerequisites

1. There should be rabbitmq-server on your server or your localhost.(However this is long-running process. If there is a static ip server or if connection on the localhost is not break, you can use this server.)
2. New user should be added for credential on rabbitmq management system.
3. There should be a grid-system which has 50-100 cluster which has anaconda module.

### Running the process
1. Install rabbitmq and start the server
2. Run the appReader.py which creates appStore.db database which has information of apps.

* **Note: ** this step may take 7-8 hours to execute. Be patient.
* **Note: ** I also upload an example database which has 1.3 million app id 
3. After Step 2 done, Run the new_task.py which sends information rabbitmq server.
4. Run the worker.py on clusters
	1. Download environment.yml, appStore.sh, Makefile, worker.py on your cluster workspace.
	2. Run 'make' command how many cluster you want to work
5. After Step 3 done, Run read_responds.py which updates appStore.db which you created on Step 2

After all steps, information of applications is ready.
